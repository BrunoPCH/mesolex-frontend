      <p>Chicahuaxtla Triqui
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/chic1273" target="_blank">chic1273</a></code> is
        spoken in 15 communities clustered around San Andrés Chicahuaxtla
        (municipality of Putla, Oaxaca). The polygon in which this language is spoken is small (approx. 40 sq. km); its
        lands are generally at a relatively high altitude (&#62; 2,000 m). Chicahuaxtla Triqui maintains the
        fortis&#8209;lenis
        distinction consonant distinction noted in the Triqui language group. Although lenis occlusives tend to be
        voiced in monosyllabic words, length continues to distinguish other fortis vs. consonants. The tonal inventory
        is relatively abundant with 4 level tones (1 low to 4 high) along with 3 rising and 3 falling tones (a
        “superhigh” 5 tone may be simply an allotone of 4 in the rising 35 contour). Chicahuaxtla Triqui, as opposed to
        other Triqui languages, is noteworthy for the occurrence of phrase&#8209;final rearticulated vowels, a reflex of
        a floating tone.
