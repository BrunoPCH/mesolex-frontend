      <p>San Martín Duraznos Mixtec, closely related to Juxtlahuaca Mixtec
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/juxt1235" target="_blank">juxt1235</a></code>, is
        spoken in a village of this
        name, with
        &#126;1,000 residents, located in northwestern Oaxaca. A small migrant community (
        &#126;50 individuals), lives
        in Oxnard, California. The segmental phonology of S.M. Duraznos shows prenasalized stops and affricates; the
        latter includes both palato-aveolar and alveolo-palatal forms. The tonal inventory is basic: high, mid, low,
        apparently without sandhi (i.e., no floating tones). Perfective verbs commonly use a low-tone prefix, <i>i-</i>
        or <i>ixi-</i>
        whereas the imperfective shows the common use of a high tone on the first mora, except in the case of motion
        verbs. Negation of the irrealis is marked by a mid-tone prefix (<i>i-</i> or <i>u-
          &#47;o-</i>) and a shift to a high tone on the
        first mora of the stem (affirmative irrealis aspect never has a high initial tone). This can be compared to the
        low-high tone of irrealis negation in other Mixtec languages. Otherwise negation is realized by a separate
        preverbal word: <i>kòó</i>.
