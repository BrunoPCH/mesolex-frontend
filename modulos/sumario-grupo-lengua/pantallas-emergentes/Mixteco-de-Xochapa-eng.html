      <p>Xochapa is a small Mixtec-speaking
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/xoch1238" target="_blank">xoch1238</a></code> town
        located about 12 km southwest of Alcozauca in eastern
        Guerrero, just west of the Mixteca Baja in Oaxaca. Xochapa is little documented and most of the information is
        found in a small dictionary that is available in this sub-portal. However, a master’s thesis and in-process
        doctoral thesis by Juana Mendoza Ruiz on Alcozauca Mixtec, a very closely related language, describes the
        segmental and tonal phonology of Alcozauca and frequently compares this phonology to that of Xochapa and other
        nearby related languages such as Yoloxóchitl Mixtec. All three manifest four level tones, with an innovative
        low-mid tone not found in other Mixtec languages.
