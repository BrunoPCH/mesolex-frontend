      <p>The totonac variant spoken in Zongozotla is classified as Highland Totonac
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/high1243" target="_blank">high1243</a></code>, a
        branch of Sierra
        Totonacan that includes a significant number of communities in northeastern Puebla (e.g., Huehuetla, Olintla,
        Coyutla, Coatepec, Ozelonacaztla, Zapotit√°n de Mendoza). These villages are located in an area that stretches
        about 15 km from Zongozotla in the south to Olintla and Huehuetla in the north. As is general in Sierra
        Totonacan, Zongozotla unambiguously distinguishes singular and plural in combinations of 1st- and 2nd-person
        subjects and objects. It has a plural morpheme, <i>qu:-</i>, that indistinctly marks both subjects and objects
        in
        transitive verbs. Sierra Totonac also marks the imperfective with a word-final <i>-y</i>, absent in other
        Totonacan
        languages. Other markers of Sierra Totonacan are lexical, though many of these words are shared with lowland
        Papantla Totonac. In Zongozotla laryngealized vowels are difficult to perceive word- and phrase-internally; they
        are marked by tense voice with no raising, or lowering (as with creaky voice), of f0.
