      <p>Huautla Mazatec
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/huau1238" target="_blank">huau1238</a></code>
        was the first of the present 9 Mazatecan languages to split from the main branch. It
        is also the most widely documented Mazatecan language and is well-known for being that of Marina
        Sabina, an
        iconic curer whose prayers have been recorded and translated into Spanish and English. In terms of its
        phonemic
        system, Huautla Mazatec has 4 vowels (i,&nbsp;e,&nbsp;a,&nbsp;and&nbsp;o). It maintains oral and nasal
        distinctions but
        has lost
        both creaky voice and breathy voice vowels, two of the four phonation types common in many other
        Mazatecan
        languages. Instead, in Huauatla Mazatec the laryngealized and breathy features are realized on a
        preceding
        consonant, which can be laryngealized or aspirated. There are 4 level tones
        (4&nbsp;high&nbsp;to&nbsp;1&nbsp;low) and, in
        the
        language of Rio Santiago represented in this portal, 3 falling and 2 rising tones.
