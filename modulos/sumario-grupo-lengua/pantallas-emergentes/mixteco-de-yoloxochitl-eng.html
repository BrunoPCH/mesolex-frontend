      <p>Yoloxóchitl Mixtec
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/yolo1241" target="_blank">yolo1241</a></code> is a
        coastal language spoken in 4 communities in the municipality of San Luis
        Acatlán: Yoloxóchitl, Arroyo Cumiapa, Buena Vista, and Cuanacaxtitlán. The variations pose almost no challange
        to intervillage communication although tone sandhi (in this case, a floating high tone) occurs in Cuanacaxtlan
        though absent in the other communities. Yoloxóchitl Mixtec is characterized by a relatively high level of
        compounding, apparently not as common in other Mixtec languages, and an extensive tonal inventory. Common tones
        in the Mixtec spoken in the Yoloxóchitl include 4 level, 3 rising, and 2 falling tones. Contour tones such as
        143 (low.high.mid) are much rarer. A few additional patterns are generated by final person-marking enclitics. As
        a result, the number of tonal contrasts in bimoraic words can be very high. For example, the segmental sequence
        nama manifests 26 distinct tonal patterns and 30 words (including 4 homonyms).
