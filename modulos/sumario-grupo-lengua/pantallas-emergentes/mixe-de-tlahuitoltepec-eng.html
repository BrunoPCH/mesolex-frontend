        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tlah1239" target="_blank">tlah1239</a></code> is part
        of a cluster of closely related, mutually intelligible varieties of Mixe
        collectively known as South Highland Mixe, spoken by approx. 17,000 people in five municipios located in the
        southwestern highlands of the Distrito Mixe in eastern Oaxaca. In Tlahuitoltepec the language is called Ayuujk.
        Tlahuitoltepec is internationally recognized for its music school, community radio station (Radio JÃ«npoj), and
        outspoken community leaders, who have gained international attention for their advocacy work on behalf of
        indigenous cultural and linguistic rights. Tlahuitoltepec Mixe has a large inventory of vowels (7 distinct
        qualities), an inverse-direct alignment system and rich verbal morphology. Tlahuitoltepec Mixe makes extensive
        use of grammaticized body parts, positional roots, and sound symbolic expressions.
