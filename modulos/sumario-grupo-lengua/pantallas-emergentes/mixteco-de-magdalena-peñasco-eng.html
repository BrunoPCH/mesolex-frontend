      <p>Magdalena Pe単asco is a town and municipality located in the Western Mixteca Alta, about 15 km east southeast of
        Tlaxiaco, in the Tlaxiaco district of Oaxaca. The Mixtec spoken here
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/magd1235" target="_blank">magd1235</a></code> has been
        described by Elena
        Erickson de Hollenbach, who has published an extensive grammar, a dictionary (accessible via this Magdalena
        Pe単asco sub-portal) and an article on Magdalena Pe単asco tone. The tonal sistem is basic, with high, medium, and
        low level tones and one rising tone (low-high). But the sistem is complicated by final floating tones, high or
        low, that may change the first tone of a following word and by word initial high tones that may be strong or
        weak/variable, i.e., high tones that change to low if the previous word has a final low floating tone.
