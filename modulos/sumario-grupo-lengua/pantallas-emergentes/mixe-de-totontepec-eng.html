        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/toto1305" target="_blank">toto1305</a></code>, also
        known as North Highland Mixe or Ayöök, is spoken by &#126;5,000 people in and around the municipio of
        Totontepec, plus by several hundred Totontepecano immigrants living in Oaxaca City, Mexico City,
        and other parts of Mexico and the United States. At an early date Totontepec Mixe split off from other Oaxacan
        Mixe languages; consequently, mutual intelligibility between Totontepec and the rest is low. While Spanish use
        is on the rise in Totontepec, many children still learn and speak the language. It has the largest vowel
        inventory of any Mesoamerican language (9 distinct qualities) and highly complex syllable structure (8 different
        nuclei shapes and codas with clusters of up to 5 consonants). It is a polysynthetic, head-marking language with
        left-branching syntax, an inverse-direct alignment system and rich verbal morphology. Totontepecano Mixe makes
        extensive use of grammaticized body part roots, positional roots, and sound symbolic expressions.
