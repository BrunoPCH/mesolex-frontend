      <p>San Pedro Amuzgos
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sanp1260" target="_blank">sanp1260</a></code>
        is the municipality in which one of three Amuzgoan languages is spoken. Located on
        the Tlaxiaco to Pinotepa Nacional highway, S.P. Amuzgos comprises an urbanized municipal center and 9 outlying
        colonies where, in general, Amuzgo is more highly conserved and used in almost all everyday interactions. The
        language itself is characterized by a segmental phonology with a relatively abundant set of vowels and a
        relatively reduced set of consonants that, nevertheless, may occur in complex clusters. For example, nasals may
        precede all stops and affricates, whereas an
        &#60;h&#62; may follow any non-palatalized stop. Of the seven oral vowels
        all but the high front (&#60;i&#62;) and back (&#60;u&#62;) also occur as nasalized; these high vowels are the
        only ones that
        occur at the beginning of the approximately 10 oral and nasal dipthongs. Tonal phonology is complicated
        and still under analysis. Discussions are presented in the articles and manuscripts available through the
        SPA Amuzgo library.
