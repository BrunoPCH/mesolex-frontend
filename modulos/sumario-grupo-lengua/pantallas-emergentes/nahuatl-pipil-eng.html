      Nawat <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/pipi1250" target="_blank">pipi1250</a></code>, the
      preferred autonym, is the southernmost Aztec language, spoken now only in western El
      Salvador. Previously it, or closely related languages, were spoken in other neighboring Central American
      countries. The ancestors of present-day Nawat migrated from central Mexico in the late Classic and early
      Postclassic periods (800–1250 AD), though there is much debate about the timing, the number, and the events that
      provoked this migration. It is now a critically endangered language, though recently revitalization efforts have
      been undertaken among the younger generation. Nawat is characterized by having the &#60;t&#62;, not &#60;tl&#62;,
      phoneme; <i>-t</i> is also the plural marker rather than the more expected <i>-h</i> and &#60;t&#62; appears in
      many contexts in which other Nahuatl languages manifest &#60;h&#62; (e.g., the plural perfective ending
      <i>-ket</i>. Nominal stems that end in &#60;l&#62; have lost the absolutive (hence <i>kal</i> ‘house’) and the
      erstwhile progressive ending <i>-tuk</i> (cf. <i>-tok</i>
      elsewhere) has a resultative and perfect sense in Nawat: <i>wa:ktuk</i> ‘it is dry’ and ‘it has dried’.
