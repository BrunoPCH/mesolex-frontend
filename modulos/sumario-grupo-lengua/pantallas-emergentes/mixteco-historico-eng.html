      <p>Historical Mixtec comprises a comparative data sets from two available sources: Michael Dürr: A preliminary
        reconstruction of the proto-Mixtec tonal system; 110 cognates from 17 communities; and Kathryn Josserand:
        Mixtec dialect history; 188 cognates from 101 communities. As additional material is developed (for example, a
        set of &#62; 1000 cognates from the four communities in which Yoloxóchitl Mixtec is spoken, or a more
        wide-ranging and digitally recorded set of cognates from some of the communities that Josserand documented) it
        will be added
        to the Historical Mixtec subportal thus enabling researchers and native speakers a greater understanding of the
        relationships among Mixtec languages.</p>
