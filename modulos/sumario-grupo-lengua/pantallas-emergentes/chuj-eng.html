      <p>This sub-portal presents the Chuj-English dictionary from San Mateo Ixtatán, Huehuetenango, Guatemala, compiled
        by Nicholas Hopkins. As is common in Mayan languages, Chuj
        <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/chuj1250" target="_blank">chuj1250</a></code>
        manifests glottalized stops (&#60;t’&#62; and &#60;k’&#62;) and affricates (&#60;ts’&#62; and
        &#60;ch’&#62;); whereas the bilabial equivalent is realized as a voiced implosive [ɓ]).
        The fieldwork upon which the dictionary is based ended in 1970; Hopkins began work on the Chuj
        dictionary in 2011. Particularly noteworthy is the inclusion of plant and animal names, with scientific
        names for the latter provided by Dennis Breedlove whose collection numbers are given in the lexical
        entries. The entries include grammatical classification of the headword and document inflectional
        patterns (particularly for verbs and nouns). The gloss is often followed by additional notes on meaning
        and illustrative phrases. Cross-references may be given to other entries.
