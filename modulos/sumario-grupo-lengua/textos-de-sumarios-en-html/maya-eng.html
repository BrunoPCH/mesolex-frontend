<p>Mayan languages
    <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/maya1287' target='_blank'>maya1287</a></code>, spoken in
    Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize, have been extensively studied in their modern variants, in extensive colonial
    documentation (dictionaries and texts), in glyphic archaeological and codex records, and in reconstructed
    proto&#8209;forms. Extensive documentation of modern Maya (grammars, dictionaries, comparative studies) is the
    result of a model effort by an Indigenous Guatemalan collective: OKMA. Typologically, and unlike other Mesoamerican
    languages, Maya manifests ergative&#8209;absolutive alignment: subjects of intranstive verbs are marked and behave
    like objects of transitive verbs. A separate form exists for subjects of transitive verbs. Ergativity is not a
    recent development but has been reconstructed to proto&#8209;Mayan.
