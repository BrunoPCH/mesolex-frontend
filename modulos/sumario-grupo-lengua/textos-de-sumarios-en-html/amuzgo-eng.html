<p>Three generally recognized Amuzgo
    languages<code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/amuz1254" target="_blank">amuz1254</a></code>
    which <a href='https://glottolog.org/' target='_blank'>Glottolog</a> considers closely related tonal languages
    within the Amuzgo&#8209;Mixtecan branch of eastern Otomangue, are spoken in an enclave northwestern Oaxacan and
    southwestern Guerrero communities. Other classifications reject Amuzgo&#8209;Mixtecan as a valid "umbrella" unit and
    consider Amuzgo and Mixtecan sibling language groups. Two Amuzgoan languages, centered in the municipalities of
    Xochistlahuaca (Guerrero) and San Pedro Amuzgos (Oaxaca), have been somewhat documented, the latter by a prolific
    native speaker scholar, Ferm√≠n Tapia. The third, from Ipalapa (Oaxaca), is basically unstudied. Morphologically,
    Amuzgoan languages are unusual in manifesting active-stative subject marking on intransitive verbs.
