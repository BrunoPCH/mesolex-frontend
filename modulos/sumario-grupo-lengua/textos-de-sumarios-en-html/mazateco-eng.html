<p>According to <a href='https://glottolog.org/' target='_blank'>Glottolog</a>, the Mazatecan language group
    <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/maza1295" target="_blank">maza1295</a></code>comprises
    9 tonal languages spoken almost exclusively
    in northeastern Oaxaca, although a few spill over into adjacent communities of Puebla and Veracruz. Mazatecan is
    noteworthy for abundant and contrastive phonation&#8209;oral, nasal, breathy voice, creaky voice&#8209;as well as a
    rich tonal
    inventory, which generally includes 3 or 4 level tones and some 5 or more contours (rising and falling). Vowel
    inventories are relatively simple: 4 to 6 depending on the language. One of the more interesting features of
    Mazatecan is the existence of a well-developed whistled language, used particularly for long-distance communication.
