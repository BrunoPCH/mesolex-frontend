<p>Nahuatl <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/azte1234' target='_blank'>azte1234</a></code>
    represents the largest group of uto&#8209;Aztecan languages. uto&#8209;Aztecan itself is divided into a
    northern group (California, Utah, Arizona, and Colorado), and a southern group (southern Arizona to El Salvador).
    The general consensus is that speakers of proto&#8209;Nahuatl, the common ancestor of all Nahuatl languages,
    migrated from
    the Sonoran desert through central and southeastern Mexico to El Salvador. Nahuatl languages all manifest a
    relatively complex agglutinative verbal p (inflectional and derivational), noun incorporation, and reduplication of
    verbal, nominal, and adjectival stems. The Aztecs spoke Nahuatl and introduced many innovations that quickly spread
    to other Nahuatl languages of central Mexico.</p>
