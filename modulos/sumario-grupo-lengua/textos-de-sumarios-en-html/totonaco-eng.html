<p>Totonacan <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/toto1251' target='_blank'>toto1251</a></code>
    has been considered a language isolate (unrelated to other Mesoamerican language groups)
    although recently a Mixe&#8209;Zoque relationship has been suggested. The two branches &mdash;Tepehua (3 languages)
    and
    Totonac &mdash; are spoken across northern Veracruz and Puebla and into Hidalgo. Although internal language
    divisions are
    still debated, in general Totonac comprises two major groups (northern and lowland) with Misantla (Yecuatla) Totonac
    an outlier. Totonacan languages manifest a complex verbal morphology (both inflectional and derivational), multiple
    nominalization patterns, and a particularly extensive set of "ideophones," sound symbolic words that usually
    represent sound, olefactory, and taste perceptions. </p>
