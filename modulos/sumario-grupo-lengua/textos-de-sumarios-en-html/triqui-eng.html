<p>The three triqui languages
    <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/triq1251' target='_blank'>triq1251</a></code> are spoken
    in Chicahuaxtla, San Mart√≠n Itunyoso and San Juan Copala,
    communities located in close proximity to the mixtec and amuzgo regions of northwest Oaxaca. Triqui is invariably
    classified as a Mixtecan language and it is easy to recognize an ample series of cognates across Triqui, Mixtec, and
    Cuicatec. Two Triqui languages, Chicahuaxtla and Itunyoso, are notable for contrasting lenis and fortis consonants,
    the latter of long duration and often considered geminates. All three Triqui languages, however, have a complex
    tonal system, with 8 to 10, or possibly more, tones.</p>
