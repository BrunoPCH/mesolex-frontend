    The <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mixe1286" target="_blank">Mixe branch</a></code> of
    the <code><a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mixe1284" target="_blank">Mixe-Zoque</a></code> family
    includes two languages spoken in Veracruz (Sayultec, Olutec), an extinct language (Tapachultec) once spoken in
    southeastern Chiapas, and a complex of languages spoken in eastern Oaxaca. Mixean languages (generally grouped as
    Lowland Mixe, Midland Mixe, Southern Highland Mixe, and Totontepec Mixe) are known for their large and varied vowel
    systems and complex syllable structure, their inverse-direct morphosyntax, and their lexical richness. Mixe verb
    complexes can include grammaticalized body part roots to express directionality and verb roots that specify the
    shape of the direct object (“classifying verbs”). They utilize valence changing affixes to add or subtract
    arguments, and they express aspect, mood, evidentiality through inflectional affixes.
