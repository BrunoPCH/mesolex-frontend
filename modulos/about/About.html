            <p>
              <em>Mesolex: Lexicosemantic Resources for Mesoamerican Languages</em> is a multimedia portal that offers
              all potential users open access to a wide range of resources on Mesoamerican languages. The portal was
              developed out of dissatisfaction with the resources available to native speakers, the general public, and
              the academic community to learn about, study, and hear actual audio recordings (transcribed and
              translated) of the many native languages spoken in the Mesoamerican cultural area. Portal navigation to
              the resources is organized around two major themes or pathways: (1) Languages (accessed by clicking on the
              <a href="https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/es/languageIndex">Language Index</a>); and (2) Topics
              and media (accessed by clicking on the <a
                href="https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/en/topicIndex">Topic Index</a>).
              Mesolex is not only a
              hub for accessing resources but provides innovative tools for discovery and display of these resources.
              Particularly important are the language&#8209;specific back&#8209;end tools that will be created for all
              dictionaries
              (e.g., a finite state transducer, a thesaurus, and a multilanguage search tool) and the open&#8209;source
              program <a href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/">SYLARD</a>, an ELAN&#8209;to&#8209;HTML
              conversion tool for
              line&#8209;by&#8209;line playback of transcribed and translated
              digital audio.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Mesolex portal has been created with the support of a National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of
              Digital Humanities Level 1 grant (Award HAA&#8209;266482&#8209;19). Content has been provided by multiple
              individuals
              and sources, all credited on the relevant pages. Indeed, a major goal of Mesolex is to provide
              contributors, particularly native speakers documenting their own languages, a mechanism through which they
              can disseminate the material that they gather and edit (e.g., theses, articles, lexicons, multimedia
              including line&#8209;by&#8209;line audio playback). The ultimate goal of Mesolex is to create a platform
              that makes it
              easy for contributors to create language&#8209;specific “subportals” and for end users to access the
              material so
              deposited through either the language or topic index. Mesolex is not meant to be a permanent archive for
              long&#8209;term preservation but rather a portal to (1)&#160;facilitate discovery and access of materials
              archived
              elsewhere and (2)&#160;develop metadata structures and content that can be exported and facilitate
              accession to
              permanent archives. Efforts are already underway to ensure that Mesolex materials (e.g., dictionaries,
              transcribed/translated audio) are also archived at institutions capable of long-term, secure preservation.
              In sum, the goal of Mesolex is to offer a language- and topically&#8209;organized lexicosemantic resource
              center
              for open access dissemination of lexicosemantic resources while at the same time providing a pathway for
              the permanent archiving of materials that are not published or otherwise permanently archived.
              The following two sections of this document present the two major pathways to materials accessible via
              Mesolex.

          <div class="contenedor-8-col m-top-2rem ">
            <h2 class="titulo-estaticas">Library</h2>
            <p>The library module is a link to files (for the most part pdfs) relevant a particular terminal language.
              Thus the subportal for the terminal language Yoloxóchitl Mixtec will include much published and
              unpublished material (e.g., conference presentations, an illustrated ethnobotanical guide) relevant to
              this language. All library materials are open access.</p>
            <h2 class="titulo-estaticas">Videos</h2>
            <p>The video module is simply a catalogue with links to online videos (mostly posted in YouTube) relevant to
              any of the terminal languages represented in Mesolex. The administrator of each terminal language portal
              is free to select and create any links that he or she might wish. The Mesolex video module will integrate
              this into a searchable catalogue much as the Library module does with textual materials.</p>
            <h2 class="titulo-estaticas">Audio: SYLARD</h2>
            <p>SYLARD (Synchronized Language Annotation Result Display) is <a
                href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/source_code">open-access software</a> that converts ELAN
              files
              (.eaf extensions) to HTML for line-by-line playback of the audio recordings. End users can configure the
              display in many ways, as explained in the SYLARD <a
                href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/usermanual">User Manual</a>, changing, for example, the
              language of the
              displayed translated texts (e.g., from Spanish to English, if the original ELAN file has both languages),
              or altering the display to a design that the user prefers.</p>
            <p>SYLARD has been developed to facilitate easy and direct native speaker, general public, and researcher
              access to language documentation material often not easily discoverable and invariably difficult to play
              for individuals not familiar with <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan">ELAN</a> software. Under
              present archiving practices, users need to download
              an ELAN .eaf file, download the associated audio (.mp3 or .wav), install ELAN on a local computer, link
              the audio and transcription files in ELAN, and play back through the ELAN interface. This is a challenge
              for those not familiar with ELAN. SYLARD offers an easy alternative. Discovery of relevant materials in
              the Mesolex portal is facilitated by a <a
                href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/catalog">searchable catalogue</a> (with easy-to-create
              filters by, for example,
              language). Immediate line-by-line playback of the audio material can be through any web browser.</p>
            <p>SYLARD can be accessed <a href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/">directly</a> or through the
              Mesolex <a href="https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/topicIndex">Audios</a> module. </p>
            <h2 class="titulo-estaticas">Lexicons</h2>
            <p><b>Back-end search tools for Mesolex lexicons offer</b> an innovative approach to look-up in Indigenous
              language
              dictionaries. The tools address the following problems, each discussed in turn:</p>
            <ol class="lista-ordenada-estaticas">
              <li>Linguistic and orthographic variation among closely related languages;</li>
              <li>Difficulty of discovery of Western language (usually Spanish or English) glosses;</li>
              <li>
                Searches across bilingual Indigenous language dictionaries that are written with different L2
                languages.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="titulo-estaticas">1. Linguistic and orthographic variation</h3>
            <p>Linguistic and orthographic variations among closely related languages often complicate dictionary
              look-up for end users. For example, a native speaker of Nahuatl may enter a search for the headword
              <em>tlacatl</em> (‘man’) and be frustrated when no results are returned because the dictionary being
              searched
              spells this word <em>tla:katl</em> (with the length of the initial &#x3c;a&#x3e; marked as long via a
              colon, and
              the
              voiceless velar occlusive [k] written as &#x3c;k&#x3e;, not &#x3c;c&#x3e; as the user entered). These are
              <em>
                orthographic
                variations
              </em> that stymy look-up and discovery. Or, if the dictionary is of Highland Puebla Nahuatl, a
              user search for &#x3c;tlacatl&#x3e; would miss the cognate form &#x3c;ta:kat&#x3e;. Highland Puebla
              Nahuatl has lost
              &#x3c;tl&#x3e;, which is always realized as &#x3c;t&#x3e;. Concomitantly, a &#x3c;t&#x3e; in Highland
              Puebla Nahuatl may
              be
              realized as either &#x3c;t&#x3e; or &#x3c;tl&#x3e; in other Nahuatl languages. These are <em>linguistic
                variations</em> that stymy look-up and discovery.
            </p>
            <p>In general these two challenges to dictionary look-up (orthographic and linguistic) are addressed ad hoc
              by end users who must essentially work out how they need to change their search input. Mesolex integrates
              a solution that effectively removes much of the burden of look-up from end-users. To accomplish this
              Mesolex has integrated language-specific finite state transducers (FSTs) into its back-end. User-generated
              searches (e.g., for &#x3c;tlacatl&#x3e;) can be processed through these FSTs so that searches
              automatically discover many common orthographic and linguistic variations without any change to the search
              input. Mesolex has
              also integrated, into this same flexible search functionality, neutralization of certain
              language-specific phonemic distinctions. For example, searches in Nahuatl can ignore vowel length,
              searches in Mixtec can ignore tonal differences, searches in Mazatec and Totonac can ignore differences
              in phonation, and searches in Triqui can ignore the contrast between fortis and lenis consonants. All
              this flexibility is automatic as it is part of the language-specific FSTs that are built into the
              Mesolex back-end system.</p>
            <h3 class="titulo-estaticas">2. Glosses</h3>
            <p>Users may also be frustrated when searches in the Western language, even for the most basic vocabulary,
              fails to find an Indigenous language equivalent. Often this is because of decisions made by the
              lexicographer during data entry. Thus a search for &#x3c;culebra&#x3e; might yield no hits simply because
              the
              entries for <i>ko¹o⁴</i> in Mixtec, <i>kowa:t</i> in Nahuatl, or <i>lu:wa'</i> in Totonac provided the
              gloss
              &#x3c;víbora&#x3e;
              or
              &#x3c;serpiente&#x3e; and not &#x3c;culebra&#x3e;. Mesolex has a back-end thesaurus (“word net”) that
              discovers synonyms
              and concatenates them into the search string. With this functionality, a user who actives the
              back-end thesaurus and looks for an Indigenous language entry for &#x3c;culebra&#x3e; will find all
              entries
              that have &#x3c;culebra&#x3e;, &#x3c;víbora&#x3e;, &#x3c;serpiente&#x3e;, or any other synonym. Or a
              search for &#x3c;contemplate&#x3e;
              would find the Indigenous words glossed as &#x3c;think&#x3e;, &#x3c;ponder&#x3e;, or other semantically
              similar words that might be in the back-end thesaurus.</p>
            <h3 class="titulo-estaticas">3. Bilingual searches</h3>
            <p>Finally, it is often the case that users might want to search across several dictionaries, some of which
              might use different languages (basically Spanish and English) for the glosses and translations. Mesolex
              will also develop a built-in (back-end) bilingual dictionary that can be activated to search across target
              languages. Thus, for example, a search for &#x3c;cat&#x3e; will find &#x3c;gato&#x3e; and a search for
              &#x3c;perro&#x3e; will find &#x3c;dog&#x3e;
              in the glosses, definitions, or translations of illustrative phrases.</p>
            <p>
              The three aforementioned search enhancements (finite state transducer, thesaurus, bilingual
              equivalences) facilitate discovery of both Indigenous language headwords (by those who may use
              different orthographies or speak different language variants) and target language glosses or
              translations.
            </p>
            <h2 class="titulo-estaticas">Flora and Fauna</h2>
            <p>The Flora and Fauna module is an ebook in development of ethnobiological knowledge. The prototype version
              presently in Mesolex is limited to ethnobotanical knowledge in a wide range of communities in central
              Mexico.</p>
            <p>
              Note that the illustrated ethnobotanical guides can be accessed either by a terminal language subportal or
              by keyword in the Library module. For example, the illustrated ethnobotanical guide for Yoloxóchitl can be
              found through the Yoloxóchitl Mixtec subportal or, easier, by a filter (e.g., ‘ethnototany) in the Library
              module.

            <h2 class="titulo-estaticas">Overview</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/en/languageIndex">Language Index</a> is another
              way
              to find Mesolex resources. In this pathway a user first accesses the
              Language group module (e.g., Amuzgoan, Maya, Mazatec, Mixe, etc.), which is a high-level taxonomic node in
              a phylogenetic language tree. The exact node chosen is in some sense arbitrary. Thus Amuzgo-Mixtecan is
              not represented but rather slightly lower-level nodes such as Amuzgoan, Mixtec, and Triqui (Cuicatec might
              be added at some point, or Mixtec changed to Mixtec-Cuicatec). Once the user clicks on a language group,
              they are taken to a list of what may be referred to as “terminal languages”. For example, the <a
                href="https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/en/languageIndexView/mixtec">
                Mixtec
                language group
              </a> comprises 4 terminal languages plus “Historical Mixtec (proto-Mixtec)”. Finally, by
              clicking on any one of the terminal languages, the user is taken to a terminal language page such as that
              for San Pedro Amuzgos Amuzgo depicted below.</p>
            <h4 class="titulo-estaticas">Example terminal language page</h4>
            <img class="imagen-estaticas-columna-grande" src="about-index-imagenes/pantalla-emergente-about-en.jpg"
              alt="Example terminal language page">
            <p>As clear from the above screenshot, the footer of terminal language pages presents the Topic modules as
              they appear in the Topic Index. Accessing the resources through the terminal language page in effect
              simply filters all resources so that only those pertinent to the language being researched appear when the
              topical links are clicked. Thus clicking on Library will present all library resources that have been
              filtered to display only those pertinent to the relevant terminal language page.</p>
            <p>
              Finally, for all terminal language pages there is an administrator, often a researcher working on that
              particular language, who selects the content for the subportal. This individual or individuals are
              credited along with any institutional support (e.g., a funding agency) that might have helped gather the
              resources presented. Each terminal language, therefore, will have distinct credits, accessible by clicking
              on the Credits link in red.
