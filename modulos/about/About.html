            <p><em>Mesolex: Lexicosemantic Resources for Mesoamerican Languages</em> is a multimedia portal that offers
              all
              potential users open access to a wide range of resources on Mesoamerican languages. The portal was
              developed out of dissatisfaction with the resources available to native speakers, the general public, and
              the academic community to learn about, study, and hear actual audio recordings (transcribed and
              translated) of the many native languages spoken in the Mesoamerican cultural area. Portal navigation to
              the resources is organized around two major themes or pathways: (1) Languages (accessed by clicking on the
              <a href="https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/languageIndex"
                alt="Mesolex Language Index">Language Index</a>); and (2)
              Topics and media (accessed by clicking on the <a
                href="https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/topicIndex" alt="Mesolex Topic Index">Topic
                Index</a>).
              Mesolex is not only a
              hub for accessing resources but provides innovative tools for discovery and display of these resources.
              Particularly important are the back&#8209;end tools for all dictionaries (e.g., a finite
              state
              transducer, a
              thesaurus, and a multilanguage search tool) and the open-source program <a
                href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/" alt="SYLARD">SYLARD</a>, an ELAN-to-HTML conversion
              tool for line-by-line playback of transcribed and translated digital audio.
            </p>
            <p>The Mesolex portal has been created with the support of a National Endowment for the Humanities, Office
              of Digital Humanities Level 1 grant (Award HAA-266482-19). Content has been provided by multiple
              individuals and sources, all credited on the relevant pages. Indeed, a major goal of Mesolex is to provide
              contributors, particularly native speakers documenting their own languages, a mechanism through which they
              can disseminate the material that they gather and edit (e.g., theses, articles, lexicons, multimedia
              including line-by-line audio playback). The ultimate goal of Mesolex is to create a platform that makes it
              easy for contributors to create language-specific “subportals” and for end users to access the material so
              deposited through either the language or topic index. Mesolex is not meant to be a permanent archive for
              long-term preservation but rather a portal to facilitate discovery and access of materials archived
              elsewhere. Efforts are underway to ensure that Mesolex materials (e.g., dictionaries,
              transcribed/translated audio) are also archived at institutions capable of long-term, secure preservation.
              In sum, the goal of Mesolex is to offer a language- and topically-organized lexicosemantic resource center
              for open access dissemination of lexicosemantic resources while at the same time providing a pathway for
              the permanent archiving of materials that are not published or otherwise permanently archived. </p>

            <p>
              <strong>SYLARD</strong> (Synchronized Language Annotation Result Display) is <a
                href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/source_code" alt="SYLARD Source Code">open-access
                software</a> that
              converts ELAN files
              (.eaf extension) to HTML for line-by-line playback of audio recordings. End users can configure the
              display
              in many ways, as explained in the <a href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/usermanual"
                alt="SYLARD User Manual">User
                Manual</a>, changing, for example, the translated texts that are
              visible
              (e.g., from Spanish to English, if the original ELAN file has both languages), or altering the display to
              a
              design that the user prefers.
            </p>

            <p>
              SYLARD has been developed to facilitate easy and direct native speaker, general public, and researcher
              access to language documentation material often not easily discoverable and difficult to play for
              individuals not familiar with <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan" alt="ELAN Software">ELAN</a>
              software. Under present
              archiving practices, users need to download an
              ELAN .eaf file, download the associated audio (.mp3 or .wav), install ELAN on a local computer, link the
              audio and transcription files in ELAN, and play back through the ELAN interface. This is a challenge for
              those not familiar with ELAN. SYLARD offers an easy alternative. Discovery of relevant materials in the
              Mesolex portal is facilitated by a <a href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/catalog"
                alt="SYLARD's Catalogue">searchable
                catalogue</a> (with easy-to-create filters by, for example,
              language); immediate line-by-line playback of the audio material can be through any web browser.
            </p>

            <p>SYLARD can be accessed <a href="https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/" alt="SYLARD Home">directly</a>
              or through the
              Mesolex <a href="https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/topicIndex"
                alt="Mesolex Topic Index">Audios</a> module.</p>

            <p>
              <strong>back&#8209;end search tools for Mesolex lexicons</strong> offer an innovative approach to look-up
              in
              Indigenous language
              dictionaries. The tools address the following problems, each discussed in turn:
            <ol class="lista-ordenada-estaticas">
              <li>Linguistic and orthographic variation among closely related languages;</li>
              <li>Difficulty of discovery of Western language (usually Spanish or English) glosses</li>
              <li>Searches across Indigenous language dictionaries that are written with different L2 languages</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>1. </strong>Users are often stymied by dictionary look-up because of orthographic and linguistic
              variation. For
              example, a native speaker of Nahuatl may search for the headword <i>tlacatl</i> (‘man’) and be frustrated
              when no
              results are returned because the dictionary spells this word <i>tla:katl</i> (with the length of the
              initial
              &#60;a&#62;
              marked as long, and the voiceless velar occlusive [k] written as &#60;k&#62;, not &#60;c&#62;). Or, if the
              dictionary is
              of Highland Puebla Nahuatl, a user search for &#60;tlacatl&#62; would miss the cognate form
              &#60;ta:kat&#62;.
              Highland
              Puebla Nahuatl has lost &#60;tl&#62;, which is always realized as &#60;t&#62;. Concomitantly, a
              &#60;t&#62; in Highland
              Puebla Nahuatl may be realized as either &#60;t&#62; or &#60;tl&#62; in other Nahuatl languages.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mesolex has integrated language-specific finite state transducers into its back&#8209;end.
              User-generated searches (e.g., for &#60;tlacatl&#62;) can be processed through these FSTs so
              that searches automatically discover many common orthographic and linguistic
              variations without any change to the search input. Mesolex has also integrated, into
              this same flexible search functionality, neutralization of certain language-specific
              phonemic distinctions. For example, searches in Nahuatl can ignore vowel length,
              searches in Mixtec can ignore tonal differences, searches in Mazatec and Totonac can
              ignore differences in phonation, and searches in Triqui can ignore the contrast
              between fortis and lenis consonants. All this flexibility is automatic as it is part
              of the language-specific FSTs that are built into the Mesolex back&#8209;end system.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>2. </strong>Users may also be frustrated when searches in the Western language, even for the
              most basic vocabulary, fails to find an Indigenous language equivalent. Often this is
              because of decisions made by the lexicographer during data entry. Thus a search for
              &#60;culebra&#62; might yield no hits simply because the entry for ko¹o⁴ in Mixtec, kowa:t in
              Nahuatl, or lu:wa' in Totonac provided the gloss &#60;víbora&#62; or &#60;serpiente&#62; and not
              &#60;culebra&#62;. Mesolex has a back&#8209;end thesaurus (word net) that discovers synonyms
              and concatenates them into the search string. With this functionality, a user
              who looks for an Indigenous language entry for &#60;culebra&#62;, having activated the
              back&#8209;end thesaurus, will find all entries that have &#60;culebra&#62;, &#60;víbora&#62;, or
              &#60;serpiente&#62;. Or a search for &#60;contemplate&#62; would find the Indigenous
              words glossed as &#60;think&#62;, &#60;ponder&#62;, or similar words that might be
              in the back&#8209;end thesaurus.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>3. </strong>Finally, it is often the case that users might want to search
              across several dictionaries, some of which might use different
              languages (basically Spanish and English) for the glosses and
              translations. Mesolex also has a built-in (back&#8209;end) bilingual
              dictionary that can be activated to search across target
              languages. Thus, for example, a search for &#60;cat&#62; will find
              &#60;gato&#62; and a search for &#60;perro&#62; will find &#60;dog&#62;.
            </p>

            <p>
              The three aforementioned search enhancements (finite
              state transducer, thesaurus, bilingual equivalences) are
              facilitate discovery of both Indigenous language
              headwords (by those who may use different orthographies
              or speak different language variants) and target
              language glosses or translations.
            </p>

            <h3 class="titulo-estaticas" id="videos-about">Videos</h3>
            <p>
              The video module is simply a catalogue of online videos
              (mostly in Youtube) relevant to any of the terminal
              languages represented in Mesolex. The administrator of
              each terminal language portal is free to select and
              create any links that he or she might wish and the
              Mesolex video module will integrate this into a
              searchable catalogue.
            </p>

            <h3 class="titulo-estaticas" id="library-about">Library</h3>
            <p>
              The library module is a link to files (for the most part
              these will be pdfs) relevant a particular terminal
              language. Thus the portal for the terminal language
              Yoloxóchitl Mixtec will include much published and
              unpublished material (e.g., an illustrated
              ethnobotanical guide) relevant to this language. Again,
              the subportal administrator can chose what documents to
              make available (including material in proprietary
              formats such as Excel).
            </p>

            <h3 class="titulo-estaticas" id="flora-&-fauna-about">Flora and Fauna</h3>
            <p>
              The Flora and Fauna module is in effect a merged
              catalogue that include all audio, video, library
              documents, or lexicons pertinent to ethnobiology. The
              material for this module is, therefore, included in and
              also accessible through the Audios, Videos, Library, and
              Lexicons modules as well as through the language
              subportals. Thus, for example, the <a
                href="https://mesolex.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/library/Yolo/Yoloxochitl-Illustrated-guide_2022-02-07.pdf">
                illustrated
                ethnobotanical guide
              </a> for Yoloxóchitl can be found
              through the Yoloxóchitl Mixtec language subportal,
              through the Library (e.g., filtering for the keyword
              “ethnobotany”), or from the Flora and Fauna module.

              The <a href="https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/languageIndex"
                alt="Mesolex Language Index">Language Index</a> is
              another pathway to Mesolex resources. Through this a user will first access the
              Language group module (e.g., Amuzgoan, Nahuatl, Maya, Mazatec, etc.) which is a high level taxonomic node
              in
              a phylogenetic language tree. The exact node chosen is in some sense arbitrary. Thus Amuzgo&#8209;Mixtecan
              is not represented but rather slightly lower&#8209;level nodes such as Amuzgoan, Mixtec, and Triqui
              (Cuicatec
              might be
              added at some point, or Mixtec changed to Mixtec&#8209;Cuicatec). Once the user clicks on a language
              group, they
              are taken to a list of what may be referred to as “terminal languages”. For example, the <a
                href="https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/languageIndexView/mixtec">
                Mixtec language group</a> comprises 5 terminal languages plus “Historical Mixtec (proto&#8209;Mixtec)”.
              Finally, by clicking
              on any
              one of the terminal languages, the user is taken to a terminal language page such as that for San Pedro
              Amuzgos Amuzgo:
            </p>
            <a href="../about/about-index-imagenes/pantalla-emergente-about.jpg" target="_blank">
              <img class="imagen-estaticas-columna-grande"
                src="../about/about-index-imagenes/pantalla-emergente-about.jpg" alt="Amuzgoan, San Pedro Amuzgos">
            </a>
            <p>As clear above, the footer of terminal language pages presents the Topic modules as they appear in the
              Topic Index. Accessing the resources through the terminal language page in effect simply filters all
              resources so that only those pertinent to the language being researched appears when the topical links are
              clicked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, for all terminal language pages there is an administrator, often a researcher working on that
              particular language, who selects the content for the subportal. This individual or individuals are
